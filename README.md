# contactsList
Vue.js as a frontend and Node.js(Express.js) as a backend.
It's a web app for keeping your contacts (name, surname and phone number) in one place.

# setup

Then you need to run two commandlines:

as a client (first terminal) go to the application directory and then go to the 'client' folder:

cd client //go to the directory

npm install //install modules

npm start

as a server (second terminal) go to the application directory and then go to the 'server' folder:

cd server //go to the directory

npm install //install modules

npm start 

The app should fire at http://localhost:8080 so type that in your browser.
